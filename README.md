# Redirect from crates.io to lib.rs
Replaces all links to [crates.io](https://crates.io) with [lib.rs](https://lib.rs), lightweight alternative to [crates.io](https://crates.io)

**Usage**
1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) extension into your browser.
2. Go to [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/Logarithmus/crates.io_-_lib.rs) and press "Install".
3. Now try searching for any crate using your favourite search engine. One of the first links will be to [crates.io](https://crates.io). If you click it, you'll be forwarded to [lib.rs](https://lib.rs). Another very common use case (as for me) is pressing [crates.io](https://crates.io) badge in crate's GitHub repository or on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs) page.
