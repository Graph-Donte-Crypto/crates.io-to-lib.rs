# crates-io-to-lib-rs
Replaces all links to crates.io with lib.rs, lightweight alternative to crates.io

**Usage**
1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) extension into your browser.
2. Go to [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/Logarithmus/crates.io_-_lib.rs) and press "Install".
3. Now try searching for any crate using your favourite search engine. One of the first links will be to *crates.io*. If you click it, you'll be forwarded to *lib.rs*. Another very common use case (as for me) is pressing *crates.io* badge in crate's GitHub repository.
